### The Preprocessor
To support multiple Minecraft versions with the ReplayMod, a [JCP](https://github.com/raydac/java-comment-preprocessor)-inspired preprocessor is used:
```java
        //#if MC>=11200
        // This is the block for MC >= 1.12.0
        category.addDetail(name, callable::call);
        //#else
        //$$ // This is the block for MC < 1.12.0
        //$$ category.setDetail(name, callable::call);
        //#endif
```
Any comments starting with `//$$` will automatically be introduced / removed based on the surrounding condition(s).
Normal comments are left untouched. The `//#else` branch is optional.

Conditions can be nested arbitrarily but their indention shall always be equal to the indention of the code at the `//#if` line.
The `//$$` shall be aligned with the inner-most `//#if`.
```java
    //#if MC>=10904
    public CPacketResourcePackStatus makeStatusPacket(String hash, Action action) {
        //#if MC>=11002
        return new CPacketResourcePackStatus(action);
        //#else
        //$$ return new CPacketResourcePackStatus(hash, action);
        //#endif
    }
    //#else
    //$$ public C19PacketResourcePackStatus makeStatusPacket(String hash, Action action) {
    //$$     return new C19PacketResourcePackStatus(hash, action);
    //$$ }
    //#endif
```
Code for the more recent MC version shall be placed in the first branch of the if-else-construct.
Version-dependent import statements shall be placed separately from and after all other imports but before the `static` and `java.*` imports.

The source code resides in `src/main` (gradle project determined by `versions/mainVersion` e.g. with `11404` it'll be `:1.14.4`) and is automatically passed through the
preprocessor when any of the other versions are built (gradle projects `:1.8`, `:1.8.9`, etc.).
Do **NOT** edit any of the code in `versions/$MCVERSION/build/` as it is automatically generated and will be overwritten without warning.

You can pass the original source code through the preprocessor if you wish to develop/debug with another version of Minecraft:
```bash
./gradle :1.9.4:setCoreVersion # switches all sources in src/main to 1.9.4
```

Make sure to switch back to the most recent branch before committing!
Care should also be taken that switching to a different branch and back doesn't introduce any uncommitted changes (e.g. due to different indention, especially in case of nested conditions).

The `replaymod_at.cfg` file uses the same preprocessor but with different keywords (see already existent examples in that file).
If required, more file extensions and keywords can be added to the implementation.
